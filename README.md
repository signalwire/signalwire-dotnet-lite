# SignalWire C#/.Net SDK

[![Build Status](https://ci.signalwire.com/api/badges/signalwire/signalwire-dotnet/status.svg)](https://ci.signalwire.com/signalwire/signalwire-dotnet) [![NuGet version (SignalWire-DotNet)](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/SignalWire-DotNet.svg?color=brightgreen)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SignalWire-DotNet/)

This library provides access to SignalWire APIs which allow you to do things like placing or receiving audio calls in .NET platform languages. For a full reference of capabilities, check out the [documentation](https://docs.signalwire.com/topics/relay-sdk-dotnet).

## Getting Started

All of the documentation material can be found at the official [Relay SDK for C#/.Net Documentation](https://docs.signalwire.com/topics/relay-sdk-dotnet) site.

## Developers

The SDK can be found at the [signalwire-dotnet](https://github.com/signalwire/signalwire-dotnet-lite) repo. To set up the dev environment, follow these steps:

1. Prerequisites: Git and .NET Core SDK
 * Install Git for your system, for Windows install msysgit if not already installed.
 * Install .NET Core for your system, see https://www.microsoft.com/net/download for more information.

2. To build from source, the `bootstrap.sh` script must be run before anything else.
 * For *nix, run the following from your shell: `./bootstrap.sh`
 * For Windows, run the git-bash and run the same above script

3. After bootstrapping, you do not need to run `bootstrap.sh` again unless there are changes to the LaML source library.

4. Building can then be performed by running the following cross-platform 'dotnet' toolchain commands: `dotnet build`

5. To create a complete set of files including dependencies, you can run the following: `dotnet publish`

6. To create a nuget package with a complete set of files including dependencies, you can run the following: `dotnet pack`

7. Under Windows you may open the solution file with VS2017 and immediately build the entire solution after `bootstrap.sh` has been run.
